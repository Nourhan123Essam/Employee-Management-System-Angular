# Employee Management System - Frontend

## üöÄ Overview

This is the **frontend** for the Employee Management System, built using **Angular**. It provides a responsive and user-friendly interface to interact with the **ASP.NET Core API Backend**. The application ensures secure access, proper routing, and smooth user experience by leveraging modern web development tools and best practices.

## üéØ Features

### üîí **Authorization and Guards**
- Guards are implemented to **prevent unauthorized access** to protected pages of the website.  
- Only authenticated users can access sensitive pages like **employee management, project details, etc.**.

### üì± **Responsive Design**
- The website is fully responsive, ensuring seamless usability across various devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Bootstrap** is used for a modern, clean, and responsive design.

### üîó **API Integration**
- Services are used to connect with the backend **ASP.NET Core API**.
- All API calls for fetching, updating, and deleting data are handled through Angular services, promoting reusable and maintainable code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Routing Configuration**
- Configured **Angular routes** to enable smooth navigation within the application.
- Modular and structured routing to support easy scalability.

### üìå **Angular Best Practices**
- Use of **constants**, **classes**, and **interfaces** to ensure consistent and strongly typed code.
- Clean and modular folder structure to improve readability and maintainability.

### üåç **Environments**
- Different environment configurations (`environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`) are used for development and production setups.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### Key Modules and Files:
- **Services**: Handles API calls for CRUD operations (e.g., `employee.service.ts`, `client.service.ts`).  
- **Guards**: Protect routes (e.g., `auth.guard.ts`).  
- **Components**: Modular components for each feature (e.g., `employee`, `client`).  
- **Environment Files**:
  - `environment.development.ts`: Configuration for the development environment (e.g., API base URL for local development). 
- **Routing**: Centralized in `app.routes.ts`.
- **Model Folder**: Contains **interfaces** and **classes** for entities.
- **Constants**: Stores some constant values.
- **Reusable-components**: Components that can receive data via **@Input()** and send data via **@Output()**, allowing easy communication between them.
